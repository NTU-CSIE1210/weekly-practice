What is recursion? Essentially, recursion occurs when you write a function that calls itself, usually with a different set of parameters, within the function. Recursion has two key features:

* The code will be relatively short: it highlights the essential _meat_ of your algorithm and assembles your output using the same procedure.
* It depicts the nature of a task â€” illustrating how self-similar the task is.

When implementing an algorithm with recursion, it's important to be mindful of the following issues:

* **Stack overflow**: When solving a problem with recursion, you need to be aware of the maximum possible depth of recursion your code can handle.
* **Computation overhead** due to function calls:
Passing arguments can be expensive, especially when copying arrays or passing large objects.

There are some workarounds that convert a recursive procedure into an iterative one.
However, these implementations often become complicated, and extra care is required in their implementation.
