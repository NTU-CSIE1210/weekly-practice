Now we discuss a divide and conquer approach to derive Catalan numbers.

**Claim:** $C_n$ satisfies the following recurrence relation:

$C_0=C_1=1$

$C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_iC_{n-1-i}$

## More Catalan Numbers

* Tiling a staircase of height $n$ using $n$ rectangles:

* Number of Permutations that avoids 312 pattern
  * Number of Permutations you can get via a stack

## Ordinary Generating Function for Catalan Numbers

For any sequence $(C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots)$ we can always write them as a formal polynomial:

$C(x) = C_0 + C_1x + C_2x^2 + C_3x^3 + \cdots $

We claim that 

$C(x) = 1 + x(C(x))^2$.

## How to solve?

This is an equation of something we might know how to solve before!
