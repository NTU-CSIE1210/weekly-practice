A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two factors.
The first few prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \ldots$.
Prime numbers have many applications ranging from cryptography to hashing.

## Primality Testing

Checking if an integer is a prime number has been a long standing question in computer science.
Today we'll be looking into two ideas:
The naive algorithm and the [Miller-Rabin's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).

## Naive Algorithm 

One straitforward algorithm is to check if every number between $2$ and $n-1$ does not divide $n$.
This requires $\Theta(n)$ division operations in the worst case.
With a brief observation we can speed up to $O(\sqrt{n})$.
If $n$ is composite, then $n=ab$ for some $a, b > 1$, which implies that the smaller factor $\min(a, b)$ must be at most $\sqrt{n}$.

Hence, it suffices to test the potential factor from $2$ to $\sqrt{n}$.

```java
boolean isPrime(int n) {
  for (int x = 2; x * x <= n; x++)
    if (n % x == 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}
```

Can we further speed it up?
Yes, we can observe that if $n$ is composite, it not only has a factor being at most $\sqrt{n}$, but this factor can also be a prime number.
Thus, we do not need to test for every integer between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$.
Instead, we test for **prime numbers** only.

Notice that division operations on a computer is much slower than addition/subtractions.
If we can find a better way to generate all prime numbers no more than $\sqrt{n}$ we should be able to speed up.

## Exercises

* Given an integer $n$, we would like to test if there are two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $n=ab^2$.
Can you devise an algorithm solving this problem in $O(\sqrt[3]{n})$ time?
