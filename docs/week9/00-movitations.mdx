## 1. Sum of Two Sets 

Consider two sets $A, B\subseteq[n]$.
The **sum** of the sets are defined as $A+B := \{a+b \ |\ a\in A, b\in B\}$.
With respect to the parameter $n$, can you find an algorithm computing $A+B$ faster than $O(n^2)$ time?

## 2. From Binary to Decimal

Given a number $X$ written in binary, how to translate it to decimal?
Suppose $X$ has $n$ binary digits, can you find an algorithm that runs faster than $O(n^2)$ time?

* This is quite useful. For example, calculating the first few digits of $\pi$ in binary is much easier than calculating in decimal, according to the [Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula).

## 3. Weighted Moving Average

Highly recommended: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA)

Given a sequence and a window of weights, can you find out the moving average for each position of the window?

## 4. String Matching with Wildcards

Suppose that you have a text $T$ and a pattern $P$ with a special wildcard symbol `?`.
Find all occurrences of $P$ in $T$, where the wildcard symbols are allowed to match with any other characters.

## 5. Coin Changing

In a coin system there are $k$ denominations $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k\}$.
In how many ways you can come up with exactly $n$ dollars?
