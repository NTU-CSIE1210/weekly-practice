## Counting number of solutions

You are given a set of numbers $S=\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ and a number $C$.
The goal is to compute the number of ways choosing a subset of numbers from $S$ that add up to $C$.

## Dynamic Coin Changing Problem

Consider the scenario that the set $S$ can be changing over the time.
In each change, a number can be added or removed from the set $S$.
For each change, you want to know whether or not it is still possible to select a subset of numbers from $S$ that add up to $C$.
