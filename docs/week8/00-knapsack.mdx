This is a category of optimization problems that is well-studied and have many real world applications.

## Classic 0-1 Knapsack Problem

:::info[0-1 Knapsack]
You have a bag of capacity $C$.
You have $n$ items, the $i$-th item has value $v_i$ and weight $w_i$.
The goal is to select a subset of items and put that into the bag, such that the total weight of these items do not exceed the capacity and the total value is maximized.
:::

Let's start with something easier.

## Warmup: Fractional 0-1 Knapsack Problem

Suppose each item is a **cake**, so you can take any partial amount of that.
How would you solve this problem?

* **Fractional Unlimited Knapsack Problem**: if each item is a ``cake type'' and you can pack as many as you want for each type. What's the solution?
* **Question**: why this idea does not apply to integer version of the knapsack problem?

## 0-1 Knapsack Problem 

This is a classical dynamic programming problem, which can be solved in $O(nC)$ time.

## Unlimited Knapsack Problem 

Suppose that each item has an unlimited number of supply, can you still solve them in $O(nC)$ time?

## Limited Knapsack Problem 

Suppose that for each item there are $k_i$ copies of them.
Can you solve the same problem efficiently?

## Very Sparse 0-1 Knapsack Problem 

The problem is the same, but $C$ could be very very large.
One way to solve the problem is an $O(n2^n)$ time algorithm.
Can you find a faster way to solve the problem?

## Applications

### Coin Changing Problem 

You have several coins. 
There are $n$ possible denominations of a coin, the type $i$ has value $c_i$ (dollars).
Suppose that you have unlimited number of coins for each denomination.
What's the minimum number of coins you need in order to pay $C$ dollars?

* **Back-and-Forth Coin Changing Problem**: Suppose you want to pay $C$ dollars to a clerk.
Both of you have unlimited coin supplies. What's the minimum number of coins both of you need in order to complete this transaction of $C$ dollars?

### Advanced: Coin Changing Problem

You are given a list of denomiations' face values. $1=c_1 < c_2 < \ldots < c_n$.
Can you determine if the Greedy algorithm always produce the minimum coin changing results?

* There's an $O(n^3)$-time algorithm for this. If the answer is "no", then the algorithm produces the minimum counterexmaple.
