## Gray Codes

Given $n$, find a permutation of $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 2^{n}-1$, such that all neighboring numbers differed by 1 bit in their binary representation.

## de Bruijn Cycle

Given $n$, find a binary string of length exactly $2^n$, such that, every consecutive $n$-bits gives a unique binary number between $0$ and $2^n-1$.

## Lyndon Words

A non-empty string $S$ is called a **Lyndon word** if, $S$ is **strictly smaller** than all its rotations.

([Roger Lyndon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lyndon) is the first person who studied this in 1954.)

### Chen-Fox-Lyndon Theorem [1958]

Every string is a **unique** concatenation of non-increasing lyndon words.

### A Magical Construction [Fredericksen and Maiorana 1978]

A concatenation of all lyndon words of lengths dividing $n$ (in lexicographical order) gives a de Bruijn cycle for $n$-bit numbers.
