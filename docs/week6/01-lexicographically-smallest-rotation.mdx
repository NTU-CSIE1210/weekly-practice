:::info[The Task]

You are given a string $S$. Find a rotation of $S$ that is the smallest in the dictionary order (the lexicographical order).

:::

For example, if $S=\texttt{abbaba}$ then the smallest rotation is $S'=\texttt{aabbab}$.

## Goals

* Naive algorithm: list out all rotations of $S$ and finds the smallest one. What's the time complexity?
* Faster algorithm?
* Fastest algorithm?

## Application: Tree Isomorphism

You are given two trees. Give an efficient algorithm that checks if two trees are isomorphic to each other.
