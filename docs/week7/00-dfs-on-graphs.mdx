## Basic Idea for the DFS algorithm

* The idea of **exploration**: imagine you are explorating a dungeon.
The dungeon can be modeled as a graph, where vertices are dungeon rooms and edges are tunnels.

* In each step, you move from your current room to **any new room** (in the actual implementation we usually pick the new room with the smallest ID), and visit it.
* If there's no new room to visit, you retreat to the previously visited room.

## "Tarjan's" algorithms

* The first paper from [Tarjan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tarjan) that coined the term "DFS algorithm" and investigated its application: https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0201010

There are earlier algorithms that uses the DFS concept but Tarjan was the first one who systematically studied and gave lots of generalizations and applications to DFS.
