## Basic Application: Count valid trees in a tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/description/

## Important Application: Lowest Common Ancestors

Suppose that there is a rooted tree $T$.
The LCA of two vertices $u$ and $v$ on a tree is defined to be the lowest ancestor $p$ of both $u$ and $v$, denoted as $\textsf{LCA}(u, v)$.

You are given a sequence of $q$ queries $(u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2), \ldots, (u_q, v_q)$.
For each query find $\textsf{LCA}(u_i, v_i)$.
