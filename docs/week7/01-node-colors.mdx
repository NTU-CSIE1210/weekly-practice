**Node colors** represent the "current state" during a depth first search.
The basic setting will be:

* 0 (white): not visited yet.
* 1 (gray): currently visiting but not finishing the search.
* 2 (black): all searches about this node is done.

## Basic Application 1: Check Connectivity


:::info[The Task]

You are given an undirected graph $G$ and a vertex $v$.
Check if all vertices are connected with $v$.

## Basic Application 2: Find Cycle on a Graph

:::info[The Task]

You are given an undirected graph $G$.
Check if there are any cycle on $G$. If there exists a cycle, output any such cycle.

## Timestamps

Each vertex can have a **start time** and **finishing time** during the DFS.

## Basic Application 3: Topological Sort

:::info[The Task]

There are $n$ tasks to be done, but there are some dependency.
If performing task $u$ requires the task $v$ to be done first, we write $u\to v$.
You are given the **directed graph** $G$ that captures all such dependencies of $(u, v)$ pairs.
Determine the order of finishing all tasks so that no dependency is violated.
(or report that it is impossible to finish all tasks without violating dependencies.)

:::

Lemma: if $u$ _requires_ $v$ (i.e., $u\to v$), then the finishing time $f(u) > f(v)$.

## Application 4: Eulerian Circuit

:::info[The Task]

You are given an undirected graph $G$, whose all vertices are of **even degree** and the graph is connected.
The goal is to find a **trail** (a path but we allow visiting the same vertex multiple times) such that each edge appears exactly once in the trail.

* The Fleury's approach (the concept is easy but implementation is hard.) [Fleury 1883]
* The DFS approach (Hierholzer's algorithm) [Hierholzer 1873]
